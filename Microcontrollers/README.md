**NodeMCU ESP8266 and Teensy v3.1**

These are PlatformIO projects for NodeMCU and Teensy microcontroller.

ESP is subscribed to a MQTT broker, which receives MQTT messages via a ROS2 node. From the MQTT commands, the ESP transmits UART signals to Teensy which rotates a motor exactly one revolution.
